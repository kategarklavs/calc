Hi [username],

{% load data_capture %}
<p>
  Unfortunately, the price list you submitted to CALC on {{ price_list.created_at|tz_timestamp }} has been <b>rejected</b>.
</p>
<p>
  The submitted price list was for contract <b>{{ price_list.contract_number }}</b> ({{ price_list.get_schedule_title }}) with <b>{{ price_list.vendor_name }}</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Visit <a href="{{ details_link }}">{{ details_link }}</a> to view its details.
</p>
<p>
  If you have any questions, please reply to this email.
</p>

Thanks,

The CALC team.
