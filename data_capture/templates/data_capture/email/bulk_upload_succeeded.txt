Hi [username],

We wanted to let you know that the Region 10 CALC data upload #{{ upload_source.id }},
uploaded by {{ upload_source.submitter.email }} on {{ upload_source.created_at|tz_timestamp }}, was successful.

{% load humanize %}
{% load data_capture %}

{{ num_contracts|intcomma }} rows of rate information have been loaded and
previous Region 10 data has been removed from the CALC database.

{% if bad_rows %}
  {{ bad_rows|length|intcomma }} were not parsed and could not be loaded.
{% endif %}

Best,

The CALC team
